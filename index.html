            <p>Hiya Mom!</p>
                <p>
                Happy 60th, and here's to many more! In honor of your laps around the sun and the 3-things stories you used to tell me and Imo when we were young, we've decided to enlist the help of some of your favorite people for a special birthday surprise. Each person gave us three things that they think of when they think of you, and Imo very snazzily compiled them all below. All told, there should be 60 of them! (Well, there should be 60, but some people might have gotten excited and gone over.) We hope they give you lots of story inspiration, or maybe just make you smile.
                </p>
                <p>Lots of love,
                <br>
                Graham and Imo
                </p>            <!-- <p> Dear Mum, in honor of the 3 Things stories you used to tell me and Graham, we've put together your own, very special birthday edition. We asked people for 3 things, quotes, sentences, memories, or any other thing that reminds them of you. Love you, Mum! </p> -->
